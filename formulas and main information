# Exciton Dynamics Using Compartment Models  
_A simple, clear, SEIR-style approach to Markovian, non-Markovian, and squeezed-bath environments_

This repository contains three exciton-dynamics models described using **compartment systems** (similar to SEIR epidemic models).  
All models track how an exciton moves, loses coherence, interacts with the environment, and finally decays to the ground state.

We build everything step-by-step:

1. **Model 1 – Markovian exciton dynamics**  
2. **Model 2 – Non-Markovian model with a memory compartment**  
3. **Model 3 – Non-Markovian model with squeezed p- and x-memory channels**

Each model includes:

- compartments (states)
- equations
- diagrams
- parameter definitions
- **threshold conditions** (which states survive as time → ∞)

The goal is to make different exciton environments easy to understand **without heavy quantum mechanics**.

# 1. Model 1 – Markovian Exciton Dynamics

## Compartments

- **X1** – exciton on site 1  
- **X2** – exciton on site 2  
- **D** – decohered excitation  
- **G** – ground state (absorbing, final sink)

Total population is conserved:
P1 + P2 + D + G = 1


## Parameters

- `\Delta_r` – coherent hopping rate between X1 and X2  
- `\k_deph` – dephasing rate X1/X2 → D  
- `\k_loss1`, `k_loss2` – recombination from X1/X2 → G  
- `\k_relax` – relaxation D → G

 v                           |


## Equations
dP1/dt = -ΔrP1 + ΔrP2 - (k_deph + k_loss1)P1
dP2/dt = ΔrP1 - ΔrP2 - (k_deph + k_loss2)P2
dD/dt = k_deph(P1+P2) - k_relaxD
dG/dt = k_loss1P1 + k_loss2P2 + k_relax*D

k_loss1 > 0
k_loss2 > 0
k_relax > 0→ **G → 1** at long times.

### **Decohered state D survives if:**
k_relax = 0

→ D becomes a permanent storage.

### **Excited states survive if ALL losses are zero:**


k_loss1 = k_loss2 = k_relax = 0

Then exciton keeps oscillating between X1 and X2.

### **Selective survival:**
- If `k_loss1 = 0` and others >0 → **X1 survives**
- If `k_loss2 = 0` and others >0 → **X2 survives**

These thresholds will appear again in the more advanced models.

# 2. Model 2 – Non-Markovian Dynamics (Single Memory Compartment)

Here we add a **memory compartment M**, which temporarily stores population and then returns a fraction of it.

## Compartments

- **X1**, **X2** – exciton on sites  
- **M** – memory compartment (environment with memory)  
- **D** – decohered excitation  
- **G** – ground state  

## Parameters

- `Delta_r` – coherent hopping  
- `k_mem` – rate X1/X2 → M  
- `gamma_mem` – decay of memory  
- `f_back` – fraction of memory that returns to X1/X2 (non-Markovianity)  
- `k_deph`, `k_loss1`, `k_loss2`, `k_relax` – same meanings as in Model 1

# 3. Model 3 – Non-Markovian + Squeezed Bath (p/x Channels)

This model splits the memory into **two channels**:

- **Mp** – p-quadrature memory (reduced noise)  
- **Mx** – x-quadrature memory (increased noise)  

Squeezing changes how much population goes into each memory channel.

## Compartments

- **X1**, **X2** – sites  
- **Mp** – p-memory  
- **Mx** – x-memory  
- **D** – decohered  
- **G** – ground  

## Squeezing parameters

u = cosh(r)
w = sinh(r)

Vp = 0.25 * (u^2 + w^2 - 2uwcos(theta)) # p noise
Vx = 0.25 * (u^2 + w^2 + 2uwcos(theta)) # x noise


- `r` – squeezing strength  
- `theta` – squeezing angle

## IMPORTANT THRESHOLD CONDITIONS (Model 3)

### **Squeezing-based thresholds**

**p-memory dominates when:**


theta ≈ 0
Vp small
Vx large
f_p large

→ long-lived coherence

**x-memory dominates when:**


theta ≈ π
Vx small
Vp large
f_x small

→ fast decoherence

### **Backflow threshold**
To get real non-Markovian revivals:


f_p > 0.2
or
f_x > 0.2
and
gamma_mem low


### **Ground state G becomes the only survivor when:**


k_loss1 > 0
k_loss2 > 0
k_relax > 0
gamma_mem > 0


### **Memory channels survive if:**


gamma_mem = 0


### **Decohered state D survives if:**


k_relax = 0


### **Excited states survive if:**


k_loss1 = 0 → X1 survives
k_loss2 = 0 → X2 survives

# Final Notes

- These models are intentionally simplified so that intuition is clear.  
- They preserve population exactly: the system never "loses" probability.  
- Adding sliders (via `ipywidgets`) makes it easy to explore how environmental parameters affect coherence and survival.

This README explains **all three exciton models** in a way that is easy to read and reproduce.  
You can now use the diagrams, equations, and thresholds in your GitHub project directly.
